<p>You land in the lagoon, which is thankfully deep enough that you weren't injured. you also managed to jump far enough
 from the cliff that you weren't hit by any debris. You swim over to the shore. You didn't find the medallion, but on the
 side of the cliff is a faded inscription.</p>
 <p id = "poem1">Where the cliff meets the water, lays hidden pebbles.</p>
