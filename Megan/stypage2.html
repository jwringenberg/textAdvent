    <p>After picking up a stick, you gently poke the bear three time. After the third poke the bear slowly wakes up from a deep sleep. Instead of being angry the bear is absoulety delighted to see you! The bear kindly introduces himself as Mr. Bear. Mr Bear insist on helping you through the dark woods. He says there is a creek not too far. Would you like to follow Mr. Bear towards the creek or continue alone through woods?</p>
