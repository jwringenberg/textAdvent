		<p>
		<span id="technofont">Part 4-IMGMK:</span>
		The user, suspicious of viruses due to the opening of gimp-2.8.exe, started an antivirus, which destroyed <span id="usernamefiller">n3k0.exe</span>. No information was gleaned because of this.<br><span id="pixellyfont1">End Rating: 9/16</span><br>
		<span id="technofont">Part 4-USNOW:</span>
		The user ended all unnecessary tasks because they thought Chrome was lagging, which ended <span id="usernamefiller2">n3k0.exe</span> as well. The program was never restarted.<br><span id="pixellyfont1">End Rating: 13/16</span><br>
		<span id="technofont">Part 4-NOTHN:</span>
		The game world itself shut down <span id="usernamefiller3">n3k0.exe</span> for failing to do its job.<br><span id="pixellyfont1">End Rating: 0/16</span><br>
		<span id="technofont">Part 5-WAITS:</span>

		The user started Windows Defender, which promptly destroyed <span id="usernamefiller6">n3k0.exe</span>. It's your mistake.<br><span id="pixellyfont1">End Rating: 6/16</span><br>
