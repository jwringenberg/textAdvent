	<h1 align = "center">You wait till the head walked/floated/crawled past you, and you went up behind and plunged the wood into the back of it's skull.</h1>
	<h1 align = "center">You walk away from it, steeling yourself to try to survive the rest of the night.</h1>
	<h1 align = "center">Just when you were about to round the corner, you hear a sputtering from the head. You go back to it and kneel down. It whispers into your ear, "I should make the difficulty harder. How does it feell to win the game?"</h1>
	<h1 align = "center">A flash hits you and you are knocked unconsious. You wake up in your bed. You live the rest of your life wondering if this is true, or if it is just a lucid dream</h1>
