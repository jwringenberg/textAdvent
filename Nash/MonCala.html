  <p>You arrive above Mon Cala and dock at the trade station amoung the many structures that make up the Mon Calamari Shipyards.</p>
  <p>As you sit on the bridge you recive a comunication.</p>
  <p>Apparently the main route back to the asteroid field station has been blocked by a battle between the Rebelion and Empire.</p>
  <p>You must choose a different route so you can make it back safely but both routes are dangerous.</p>
