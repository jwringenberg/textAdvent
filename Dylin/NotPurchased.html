  <p>You decide that the sword isn't worth the gold. If anything is in the cave, you should be able to kill it
    with your dagger. The blacksmith looks at you with annoyance as you turn and leave the shop.
    You remember the man in the tavern telling you of the dangers of walking all the way to the cave. You could buy a carriage ride,
    but that would cost your last 5 gold coins.</p>

    <p>Will you ride the carriage, or try to walk to the cave?</p>
