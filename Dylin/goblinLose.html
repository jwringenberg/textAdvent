<p id = pageHeader>Goblins!</p>
<p>You start down your chosen path. After several minutes of walking, you come to a gate made of gold.
  Seeing the gate, you know you must be close to the crown. As you approach the gate to inspect it, you hear shuffling behind you.
  You begin to turn around to look, but immediately feel the cold edge of a knife against your throat. The creature behind you
  orders the others to to take any gold on you. Unfortunately for you, you've already spent all of your gold on the carriage ride and
your sword. You feel tiny green hands reach into your empty pockets. The creatures exchange words briefly, and the blade slides
across your neck.</p>
