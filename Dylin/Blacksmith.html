  <p> You decide to go to the village blacksmith to see what he has in stock.
    You speak to him, and he informs you that he only has one weapon that you can afford.
    He places the worn sword on the wooden countertop. The blade is dull, and the handle
    has seen better days. He informs you that it's only 5 gold.</p><br>
