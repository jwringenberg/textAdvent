  <p>You proceed through the gate, and continue walking. Minutes later, you come to a large, open chamber.
    The room resembles a throne room, built for royal blood. Beams of light shine down through the many
    cracks of the cave walls, and you hear water running in the distance. One ray of light shines directly onto the throne itself,
    drawing your attention to the glistening crown resting on it.</p><br>
