  <p>Once you pick up the crown, the wall in front of you begins to move, revealing another tunnel.
  You go through the tunnel, and find that it wraps around all the way to the entrance of the cave.

newly-found treasure. You return to the village, sell the crown, and become the wealthiest nobleman in the area.</p><br>
