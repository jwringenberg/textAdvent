  <p>You are a peasant. You're sitting in a local tavern, having just spent one of your last gold coins on a mug of ale.
    As you drink, you beggin to listen to the words of the taverns patrons. They speak mostly of hardships and ill-willed rumors.
    However, one conversation catches your attention. Rumors of the crown of a fallen king, deep in a forlorn cavern. The crown is said you be
    made of pure gold, and adorned with the finest diamonds and jewels of the realm. If you were to obtain such a treasure, you could finally life a life
    of luxery.
    You approach the stranger, and he asks for your name.<br><br>
    Will you tell the stranger your name and embark on the quest?
