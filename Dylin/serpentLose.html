  <p>You start down your chosen path. After several minutes of walking, you come to a gate of rusted steel.
    Seeing the gate, you know you must be close to the crown. As you approach the gate to inspect it, you hear shuffling behind you.
    You spin around, and see a serpent towering over you! You try your best to fend off the beast with your measly dagger,
    but the serpent manages to bite you in half within a matter of seconds.</p><br>
