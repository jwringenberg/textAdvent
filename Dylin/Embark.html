  <p>After telling the man your name, he informs you exactly where the crown is said to be located. Unfortunately for you,
    the cavern is supposedly on the opposite end of the kingdom, and would take a man at least a week to travel to on foot.
    You are also equiped with only a dagger, and 10 gold coins.<br>
    Will you risk traveling to the location on foot, spend 5 gold coins on a carriage ride to the cave, or
    go to the local blacksmith for a new weapon?</p>
