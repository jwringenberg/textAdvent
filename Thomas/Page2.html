This maze is extremely hard and is physically and mentally unforgiving
</br>
Many people have tried to complete this labyrinth, but none have succeeded or survived
</br>
(nobody has ever come back) if you just so happen to make it through
</br>
there is a beacon that you will turn on to let everyone know that you are the ultamite champion.
