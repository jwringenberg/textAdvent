	Congratulations you have succeed in crossing the bridge, you might be thinking how you got across it
	</br>
	if I said no one else has ever done it, well I lied.
	</br>
	Now you must chose another direction to go from here
	</br>
	but I will not give you any advice on which way to go this time.
	</p>
	<p>
	This time you must enter The Great Maze no matter what direction you go,
	</br>
	but one way will end up getting you killed
	</br>
	and the other will grant you victory.
