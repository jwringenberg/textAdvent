Hooray! You've beat the beast.
<br>
Now, You are so close you can almost taste it.
<br>
Look in your backpack and come up with a tool that
<br>
can help you finish your mission.
<br>
What will it be?
<br>
Great idea! Create a compass and binoculars to lead you to the West.
<br>
This way, the sun will reflect off the water and
<br>
the reflection will help you see through the forrest and bring you
<br>
to freedom!
