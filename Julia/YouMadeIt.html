Congratulations Warrior! You did it!
<br>
You found your way through the corrupt world to 
<br>
a better place.
<br>
Go ahead and enjoy yourself now!
<br>
You've earned! Sit down and relaxe.
<br>
Grab some food and a refreshment while listening to that
<br>
ocean wave crashing on the shore with the wind blowing 
<br>
your hair!
