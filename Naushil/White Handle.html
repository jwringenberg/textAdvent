<p>You emerge to see the same room, but the doors are in a different place now. Suddenly, the door you took is engulfed in water, prohibiting you from going back.<br>
You see a sign in front of you.

<p>It reads,<br>
"The maker doesn't want it,<br>
The buyer doesn't need it<br>
And the user never sees it.<br>
What am I?"</p>
<p>You think, "What the heck?"</p>
<p>You spy two doors, one with a brown handle, and one with a white handle.</p>
<p>Which door do you choose?</p>
