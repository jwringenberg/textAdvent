<p>You emerge just as the path you took suddenly get engulfed in water, prohibiting you from going back.<br>
You see a sign in front of you.
</h1>
<h2>
<p>It reads,<br>
A man is leaving on a business trip and stops by his office on the way to the airport.<br>The night watchman stops him and says,<br>"Sir, don't take that flight.<br>I had a dream last night that your plane would crash and everyone would die!"<br>The business man cancels his trip and sure enough, the plane crashes, killing all the passengers.<br>The man gives his watchman a $10,000 reward for saving his life, then fires him.<br>Why?
<p>You think, "What the heck?"</p>
<p>You spy two doors, one with a sun on it, and one with a moon on it.</p>
<p>Which door do you choose?</p>
