<p>You emerge just as the path you took suddenly get engulfed in water, prohibiting you from going back.<br>
You see a sign in front of you.

<p>It reads,<br>
"Eating white is what I usually do<br>
If quick enough, some fruit and something blue<br>
When I see the colors pink, orange, sky blue, or red<br>
I am sure to turn my yellow head<br>
Trapped in a dark room with blue walls<br>
I fear the ghosts that roam the halls<br>
Who am I?"</p>
<p>You think, "What the heck?"</p>
<p>You spy two doors, one with a yellow handle with a wedge in it, and one with a green handle with a dot on it.</p>
<p>Which door do you choose?</p>
