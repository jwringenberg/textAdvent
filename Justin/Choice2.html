		You decide to go right, having not put too much thought into your choice.
		<br>
		After several minutes of trotting along, you encounter what looks to be a strange portal pulsing in the sky.
		<br>
		You walk up to the portal and look through it,
		<br>
		but before you can see what is on the other side, your head starts to hurt, so you look away from the portal.
		<br>
		You are now curious about what you saw on the other side.
		<br><br>
		Do you satisfy your curiosity or ignore the portal and continue on your journey?
