			You walk up to the door and knock on it three times. After several seconds, the door opens to reveal an old man.
			<br>
			He says something to you, but you don't understand what he is saying. The old man realizes this and snaps his fingers.
			<br>
			This time you understand him asking,
			<br><br>
			"What are you doing here, my starchy friend?"
			<br><br>
			You make gestures to signify that you are looking for a place to grow. The old man smiles and says,
			<br><br>
			"Well, I do have a garden where you can grow, but I think I have a solution you might like better..."
			<br><br>
			He tells you to wait there while he goes to get something.
			<br>
			Minutes later, he arrives with a staff and points it at you, chanting something you don't understand.
			<br>
			All of a sudden, you feel a tingling sensation, then you start to grow and your body starts changing.
			<br><br>
			You've become a human.
			<br><br>
			Once the transformation completes, the old man looks at you in satisfaction and says,
			<br><br>
			"Why not come in and have a drink?"
			<br><br>
			You enter his house, excited about what's to come next.
