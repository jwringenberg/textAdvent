			You are a potato that has been growing on the farm of Mr. Meaniemandudewithasuperlongnamethatnobodywantstoreadandthismakeshimsad
<br><br>
			We'll call him "Nom"
<br><br>
			Recently, you haven't been able to grow as well as you'd like because
<br>
			Nom has stopped supplying you with enough water and is giving the fertilizer to the carrots.
<br>
			Having been feed up with this, you decide to pop out and go find somewhere else to grow.
		</p>
		<p id="scenario">
			When you reach the entrance to the farm, you find that the road splits off into two paths.
