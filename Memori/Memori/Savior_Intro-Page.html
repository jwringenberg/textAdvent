A white angel appears, in the vision of the most beautiful person you can imagine. A silver lasso flows from their wrist, completely destroying the enemy which was about to kill you.  She turns to you, and begins to sing.

"It's the very first breath, when your head's been drowning underwater.  And it's the lightness in the air.  When you're there.  Chest to chest with a lover.  It's holding on, though the road's long, and seeing light in the darkest things.  And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is.  I know that you'll thank God you did."

<p id = "DungeonIntro">
The angel hugs you tight, and you fall asleep.
