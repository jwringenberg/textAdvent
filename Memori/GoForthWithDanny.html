Danny allows you to ride him, and together you two continue into Memori.
<p id = "thewhitedeer">
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side, the summer's gone and all the flowers dying. 'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
</p>
<p id = "DungeonIntro">
You look forward and see a younger version of yourself, playing in a snowy forrest.  A horn blows in the distance, and a far away army begins to storm forward-about to trample your younger self.
</p>
<p id = "thewhitedeer">
 And I will her tho' soft you tread above me.  And then my grave will warm and sweeter be.
