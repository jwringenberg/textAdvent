I shall send you on a journey.  A journey through Memori.  This place... it's your mind.  Everything you have every faced.  Everything you could ever be.  This is you...  You won't wake up until you defeat everything in here.  Can you do that for me sweety?  Can you do that, for you?

A white deer appears, walking slowly toward you... It reaches you, and bows its head. It's horns burst into flame.

<p id = "friendlynpc">
Do you remember his name? I'm afraid of what will happen if you don't...

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow.  Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow. 'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.
